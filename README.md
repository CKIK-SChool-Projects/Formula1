# Author - Dominik Kulás
- I changed the default rotation of the cars
- I changed the map size, and the run of the game
- I coded the movement (Only W and UP ARROW yet)
- I made it so that when the player goes off the field, his HP decreases by 5 every 0.5 seconds
- I coded the speed of both players
