## In the last commit.. (Author - Dominik Kulás)
- I coded the player health
- I renamed some backgrounds for the easier foundation
- I changed that from now on you lose 5 HP every 0.5 seconds instead of every 1 second if you go off the track

## TODO - By Priority

- Code the left and right movement for both player!
